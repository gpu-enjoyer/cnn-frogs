have you ever wanted to build your very
own deep image classifier well in this
tutorial we're going to do exactly that
let's do it
[Music]
what's happening guys my name is
nicholas tronat and in this tutorial as
i mentioned we're going to be building a
custom deep image classifier using your
own data now the nice thing about this
tutorial is that you can literally pull
down any bunch of images from the web
and load it into this pipeline and
you'll be able to use it to classify
images as a zero or one binary
classification type problem now in this
tutorial we are going to be very much
focused on going through the end to end
pipeline so first up what we're going to
do is focus on getting some data and
loading it into our pipeline we're then
going to take a look at some
pre-processing steps that we need to
perform in order to improve how well our
model performs then we're going to build
a deep image classifier using keras and
tensorflow so we'll build a sequential
deep neural network then we'll evaluate
it test it and last but not least we'll
save down this model so that you can
take it elsewhere and use it where you
need it ready to do it let's get to it
hey nick i was hoping to build a deep
learning model to classify some pictures
is that something that's possible what
are you trying to classify uh it's part
of my stealth tech startup we're looking
to build a cutting edge mobile app to
classify youtuber thumbnails as
wait for
it shocked face
or duck face
i'm gonna need you to sign an nda now
that you know that
so you like the idea
right
well my other idea is to use ai to
classify images of people as happy or
sad okay that that we can do we can use
image classification to do it nice how
do you get started well the first thing
we probably need is to get some images
of happy and sad people then we can use
some of the helpers inside of keras and
tensorflow to load it up so we doing
this or what yeah let's go alrighty guys
so we are going to be going through an
end to end image classification deep
learning pipeline thing
wow that got really long really quick no
so we are going to be able to build our
very own deep image classifier using
pretty much whatever data you want in
this particular tutorial this is sort of
why i wanted to show you this
so
first things first what we're going to
need to go on ahead and do and this is
what we discussed with our client is we
need to go and set up and load some data
and then in order to do that we are
going to do a couple of key things first
up we're going to install our
dependencies and set them up we're also
going to we are also going to remove any
dodgy images so i found that sometimes
when you download images from the web
i.e images the versus images that you
haven't captured yourself you can tend
to get some dodgy images or images that
are corrupt so i'm going to show you how
to remove those we are then going to
load that data so those are the first
couple of things that we need to do so
first up installing dependencies in
setup and as per usual all the code that
you see inside of this including the
entire jupyter notebook is going to be
available inside of github just check
the link in the description below
so
first things first we need to install
dependencies and setup so what we can do
in order to do that is run this
particular line here so the first line
is exclamation mark pip install
tensorflow tensorflow gpu opencv python
and matplotlib so tensorflow and
tensorflow gpu are going to be used as
part of the deep learning pipeline
itself so we are going to use the keras
sequential api in a second to be able to
go ahead and do that
opencv is going to be used when we go
and remove our dodgy images and
matplotlib is going to be used to
visualize our images so if we go and run
that that is going to go ahead and
install our dependencies so we we scroll
on down
looks like we just got a warning and
this is just telling us that we should
probably update our pip version that in
this particular case it's fine we don't
need to
cool then we can go and validate whether
or not we've got the right dependencies
installed so if we go and run pip list
let's go and take a look
so do we have tense flow so we've got
tensorflow and tensorflow gpu so we've
got 2.8.0 and 2.8.0 if you haven't
watched the beginner setup tutorial
which i just released make sure you go
and visit that particularly if you've
got a gpu and you need to set up
tensorflow with gpu acceleration i go
through it step by step so it's going to
make your life a ton easier
okay so the next thing that we need to
go ahead and do is import some
dependencies so in order to do that
we're going to import two key
dependencies the first one is tensorflow
so import tensorflow as tf and the
second one is os so we've written import
os so os is namely used let me minimize
that so os is mainly used to navigate
through file structures so typically
when i'm using os i'm using it for
os.path dot join so let's say for
example we need to go into our data
directory and we needed to go into a
folder called happy right
so what this is going to do is return
back a file structure which is
uh what is it homogeneous regardless of
what type of operating system you're
using so this is if you're using it on a
windows machine it's going to be
perfectly fine if you're using it on a
mac or a linux machine it's going to
return the folder structure in a format
which is appropriate for that particular
type of operating system now the other
main type of function that i use inside
of os is os.listia so let's say for
example i wanted to show all of the um
all of the files or all of the images
inside of a particular directory i could
actually type in os.listia and let's say
i've got a folder called data it's going
to list everything that is inside of
that particular folder now i don't have
anything in there but later on you'll
actually see that in use just a couple
of key tips on what i use os for
all right next line we are going to go
on ahead
and limit the
limit tense flow using up all of the
vram on our gpu so by default when you
load in tensorflow or you load in data
it's going to expand and use all of the
potential vram that's available on your
machine which tends to become a bit of a
nightmare particularly if you're getting
into really big models so these two
particular lines of code actually help
prevent that and it helps prevent
something called an oom error or an out
of memory error
so first thing that we're doing is we're
actually grabbing all of the gpus
available on our machine so the first
line is gpus equals
tf.config.experimental.list underscore
physical underscore devices and to that
we've passed through gpu right so if i
actually go and write that line so
gpustf.config.experimental
dot list
physical oh gosh my typing is the
shocker
devices and then if i type in gpu
this is going to give us all of the gpus
that we've got available right so you
can see i've got one there if i had a
giant machine that had multiple gpus
you'd actually see multiple there so if
i type take a look at the length
of that particular line you can see
we've only got one gpu available there
we typed in cpu
you can see again i've only got one cpu
available
right so this particular case returning
my cpu so if you wanted to see all the
devices you've got available you can
filter through on that
so that is what that line is doing there
then the next line is actually limiting
the memory growth so we're looping
through every potential gpu that we've
got inside of this line here so four gpu
in gpu so for each of the gpus inside of
this we are going to run
tf.config.experiment
underscore memory growth so this is
telling tensorflow hey don't use up all
of our memory keep it to a minimum or
keep it to whatever you absolutely need
so by limiting this it ensures that
we're going to avoid any of those out of
memory errors you might still get some
if you've got batch sizes that are too
large but that is a solvable error
cool
so we have now gone and installed some
dependencies imported a couple and we've
also gone and limited our memory growth
this next line is just showing you
exactly what i showed there so you don't
need to run that but if we go and run
that that is going to limit our memory
growth so you saw that it wasn't run
there i'm just going to run it so we are
now good so that is step 1.1 now done so
we've gone and installed our
dependencies we've got an importer
whatever we need and we've also gone and
limited our memory growth over here now
the next bit is removing dodgy images
now before we actually do that we
actually need to get some images so
the nice thing about this tutorial is
that i wanted to build it so that you
could actually go and build an image
classifier for just about anything you
wanted now the nice thing about this is
that we can actually go and get a bunch
of images from the world wide web so
we're going to be building an image
classifier an image sentiment classifier
in that particular sense
so
what do we need to do we need to get
some images of happy people so let's get
images of happy people
so i'm just going to go to google go to
images and type in happy people and you
can see we've got a bunch of overly
ecstatic people over here
they're so happy who knows what about
we're gonna go ahead and download these
now i've actually got this extension
inside of google chrome which makes my
life a ton easier when it comes to this
i don't actually know let's what's it
called uh more tools extensions
it's this one over here download all
images so if you go and get that
particular extension
this is going to be a game changer when
it comes to building deep learning stuff
right
because what we can do is from here i
can open up this extension so you can
see it says download all images there
yeah i can click that and that is going
to start downloading all of the images
from this page so you saw it just
literally when it did that so inside of
this zip folder we got all those images
so if i go to downloads open this up
take a look at that images are happy
people how cool is that
pretty awesome right so now we're now
able to build up a deep learning image
data set really really quickly so we're
going to grab that particular zip file
so i'm just going to cut that and i'm
going to take it into my image
classification repository so i haven't
actually shown you this
let's do that so this particular
notebook is here and inside of this same
folder i've got a directory called data
a directory called image classification
which is just my virtual environment
again if you haven't seen the beginner
tutorial go and jump back on over to
that because i'll show you how to set
this up i've got a folder called logs
because that's where we're going to log
stuff out we've got a folder called
models as well
now
we are going to grab this data that we
just downloaded and put it into our data
folder and i'm just going to rename it
and call it happy
just double check that is the right
thing
yeah that's cool happy people so happy
all right so we are going to go
what have we gone and done so we've got
a set of image data which is for happy
people we now need a set of data which
is for sad people kind of like when i
don't get to order pizza or beer on
friday night so we've got a bunch of
people that are sad so again we're going
to go to our extensions download those
images
so you can see it's downloading
we're good we're great that is now
downloaded over there so again we're
going to go to our downloads we're going
to grab that repository paste it over
here and we're going to call this one
assad
so we've now got inside of our data
folder we've got a 2-zip so we've got a
happy zip we've got a sad zip so we're
going to extract these now so if we go
and extract these and we're just gonna
create or extract them to a separate
folder so we're gonna extract too happy
let me zoom in because that's way too
small
happy we're gonna extract a happy i know
sometimes my code is pretty small guys
i'm i work to improve it i promise so
we're going to extract a happy
you can see we've now got a folder
called happy with all of our overly
happy people
right cool we're going to go and do the
same facade
and this has gone what's that pop up
this is saying the following imp file
already exists let's just say yes to all
okay so we've now got two folders we've
got a whole bunch of happy people
yeah cool
great now inside of our sad folder we've
got a whole bunch of sad people this
guy's clearly had a big day at work
this guy has as well
all right
so what we're going to go ahead and do
is uh what are we doing
so we're going to take these zip folders
and we're actually going to move them
back into this root folder so that way
they don't sort of mess around because
when we go and load in our data where
the keras utility is just going to look
at the subfolders that it needs in here
cool so i'm going to close that i'm
going to close that i'm going to close
it well i've opened up a ton of images
we don't need that one open either all
right cool so what have we gone down so
we're going to download a bunch of
images out people a bunch of images
happy people and we've now gone and put
it inside of our data folder if you
wanted more classes you literally just
go and download those classes paste them
in here you do need to change the neural
network a little bit if you want a
tutorial on that hit me up in the
comments below and maybe we'll make one
okay so we've gone and got our image
data sets we've got one of happy one of
sad
now we are kind of good-ish to go so the
next thing that we're going to do is
we're going to go and remove dodgy
images now let me explain why we're
doing this so sometimes when you go and
get images from the world wide web even
though they have the appropriate file
extensions they might not open up in
python because they might be corrupted
they might be mislabeled they might be
mis-extended or have the incorrect
extension applied this particular block
is going to help us get rid of that so
first thing that we need to do is import
two dependencies so we are importing
opencv so this is uh what allows us let
me actually show you so if we type in
opencv
it's a huge open c or open computer
vision
module that allows you to do a ton of
computer vision and good stuff so this
is super awesome if you've never checked
out opencv by all means do
the next thing that we are importing is
image hdr so this allows us to check the
file extensions for our particular
images so two lines there so import
opencv and import image hdr
the next thing that we're going to do is
create a variable to hold the path to
our data directory so remember inside of
here
we've got a data directory which is
called data and inside of our data
directory we've got two folders one
called happy
and one called sad right
so we're going to go and create a
variable which points to that so data
underscore dr equals data
then we are going to go and create a
list of extensions let me minimize that
we're not talking about that yet too
early so image extensions are jpeg jpg
bmp and png so this is just a standard
list so if we go and navigate through
this
uh let's actually run that first so
image underscore exts right
i haven't typed that in image
right it's literally just a list so if
we actually go and grab the first one
that's jpeg the second one that's jpg
the third one is going to be png that's
actually the fourth one
cool
so the reason that we're setting up this
is we are now going to loop into it so
remember how i told you about import os
so now what we can actually go ahead and
do let's check this out so if i type in
os dot list dr and type pass through
data deal
this should return happy and sad it
returns the folders which are inside of
this data directory if i go and run that
happy and sad pretty cool right now what
would happen if i wanted to go and check
every single image inside of the happy
folder well i could go os.path.join
pass through my data directory and then
pass through let's say for example a
happy folder
now i'm going to return every single
image inside of that subfolder
pretty cool right so this allows us to
loop through every single image that
we've got inside of that folder which is
exactly what our dodgy image script is
going to do in a second but i just
remember there's one additional thing
that we need to go on ahead and do so
before we actually go and run that image
script normally what i'll do when i'm
getting images from the interwebs is
i'll actually go into that data set
and just anything that is small or weird
i'm going to remove that so anything
which is under 10 kilobytes which is
probably going to be a really small
image and all of these weird microsoft
edge vectors we're going to get rid of
those so
from nine kilobytes onwards so you can
see let me zoom in so you can see these
are nine kilobytes eight four three so
pretty small we're gonna get rid of
those so from
here
to here delete those and if you wanted
to add in additional images so go and do
like go to another page download more go
to another page download more you could
definitely do that
okay so we've gone and removed the small
and weird images from happy let's go and
do the same from sad let's go to our
details tab
so again we're going to find 10 kb and
then we're going to delete everything
below that you can see 9 we're going to
go all the way down we're going to
remove anything smaller than that
got to get rid of that quick assist it's
driving me insane all right so down here
let's take a look nine kilobytes one
kilobyte remove those boom done all
right cool so that leaves what
effectively should work but we're still
gonna run our dodgy image script as well
just to make sure that we don't have any
weird stuff there so
remember how i said i talked about
os.listia that's exactly what we're
doing so first up we're looping through
every
folder that we've got inside of our data
directory so for image class inside of
os.list dr so this is just going to go
inside of our data directory and it
should effectively just print out happy
inside so but let's actually show you
this or let me actually show you this so
print image class
image image underscore class
so we're going to print out happy and
we're going to print out sad then what
we're going to go ahead and do is we're
going to print out every single image
inside of those subdirectories so if we
go and print that
so if i go and print image
we are printing out or looping through
every single image and then we're just
going to do a bunch of checks right so
if you wanted to do a specific check you
could go and do that i'm just double
checking that one we can load the image
into opencv and two that our image
matches one of these paths over here so
if we've loaded it up and it's still
weird we're actually going to remove it
from that particular folder
right so what we're doing is for looping
through every single one of our data
directory folders so happy and sad we're
then looping through every single image
that we've got inside of those sub
directories
so in order to do that we're in four
image underscore class in os.listia four
image.os or for image in os.listia and
then we're going into those subfolders
so we're joining the path so
os.path.join our data directory and then
our image class so this would
effectively be um happy and then well no
this would be data and then it will be
happy and then it will be data and then
it will be sad and then we're going into
that and we're grabbing every single
image explicitly so we're going os or
path.join the data directory the image
classification folder and then the image
itself and we're storing that inside of
a variable called image path and then
we're passing that through to
opencv.imread so this actually opens up
an image or it allows you to open up an
image using opencv so let's actually
test that out right
so if i type in cv2 dot i'm read
and then we need to pass through the
full file path so we're going to pass in
os.path.join
because it just makes it easier
we're then going to pass through our
data folder and then let's say for
example happy and then let's go and get
a file from happy so go to uh image
classification and then
data happy let's grab this one
looks pretty big
and we're going to pass through the
string so there's a jpg so we need the
extension as well
the image classification data happy
jpg cool
dot jpg
we need to close
that so you can see we've just gone and
read in our image as a numpy array so if
i type in let's just store it inside of
variable so i can show you type image
it's a numpy array
now what does actu this actually mean so
basically let's take a look at the shape
so we have an image of the shape what is
that three so this guy should be rows
first so it's going to be
3744 pixels high
5616 pixels wide and it's got three
channels that means it's a colored image
so if we actually go and open up that
image for d well let's actually use our
python capability so we can type in
plot.i am show
and then pass through our image
and we have we not imported matplotlib
we have not let's import matplotlib
we
let's just import up here so let's just
add in another line so um
from we're probably going to visualize
it later but i want to show you now so
from matplotlib
import pie plot as plt
let's go and run this
so that is our image there so you can
see 3 000 what is it 744 pixels high
5616 pixels wide and we it is a colored
image and you're probably wondering nick
why is it a weird color this is because
opencv reads in an image as bgr
matplotlib expects it to be rgb so if we
wanted to fix this we can type in cv2
dot cvt color
pass through the image and then pass
through a color conversion code so this
is just going to reorder the channels so
we can type in cv2.color underscore
bgr2rgb
boom
yep that should work
and there you go so you can see the
color is now fixed and we can if we
wanted to get rid of this weird line
here you can just type in plot.show
with that so pretty so again so this
particular line effectively shows you
one how you can read an image using
opencv how you can join paths using
os.path.join and how we can go and
render those okay but this is just sort
of explaining so we don't need this we
don't need this we don't need this we
don't need this and we don't need that
what we want to do is actually go and
run through our dodgy image script so
again if it's not a valid image not a
valid image extension we're going to go
and get rid of it using os.remove so
os.remove allows you to delete a file so
let's go and run this
and you can see that this is inside of a
try accept block so effectively if it
throws up any errors then we're going to
fail out of that particular block
so let's go and run that
see we've got some weird images it's
removing them
and that is done so now let's just
double check we still have a bunch of
images inside of our data folders so if
we go into data happy still got a bunch
of images there so 131 to be exact and
inside of sad we've got 74. so it looks
like it's a bit of an unbalanced data
set so we could definitely fix this up
or resample if we needed to but for now
we'll be okay
cool so we've got a bunch of images
we've gone and cleaned them up we're
looking good
so let's take a look at what we've done
so far so we've now installed our
dependencies successfully we've also
removed any dodgy images the next thing
that we want to go on ahead and do is
load our data now how are we going to do
this well tensorflow actually has a data
set api and
i originally didn't use this a ton when
i was just getting started on my deep
learning journey but now i probably use
it every single time i'm building a deep
learning model why well it actually
allows you to build data pipeline so
rather than loading everything into
memory to begin with it actually allows
you to build a data pipeline which one
allows you to scale out to much larger
data sets but it also gives you a
repeatable set of steps that you're
going to apply to your data
to be honest just makes up a lot cleaner
um there's a whole bunch of
documentation on this now if you wanted
to actually access it you can type in
tf.data.dataset
and it actually allows you to access
this tf.dataset api now we're actually
going to use it slightly differently so
rather than using the data set api
directly we're actually going to use a
keras utility which actually allows you
to do it but for example if you've in
some of the two trials that i've
actually got coming up namely iris
tracking and
which one other one did i use it in i
think for the toxic comment detection i
actually use it so typically you can
load in a data set using um tf.data
dataset from
what is it from tensors from generator
from tensor slices but you can also use
it and load in data from a directory by
typing in list files so this actually
allows you to do a wild card search i
just wanted to give you a little bit of
background on this but um we're not
going to be using it directly in this
particular tutorial but there is a ton
of capability in this uh tf data set api
okay that is the data set api talked
about now we've also taken a look at its
uh documentation so also pro tip if
you've never haven't used jupiter too
much if you type in question mark
question mark gives you the
documentation for that particular line
of code or that method which you can see
there
so next thing there are so we're
importing matplotlib there so i imported
re-imported it up here but i wanted to
show you that image visualization so we
are now importing numpy so import numpy
as np and then from matplotlib import pi
plot as plt
so if we go and run that now that's two
new dependencies imported
and then this is where we're going to
load our data so remember how i told you
that we've got this data set api here
well keras actually has a data pipeline
direct function or helper built into it
as well
and this is how we access it so in order
to use it you can type in tf.keras.utils
dot image underscore data set underscore
from underscore directory and this
actually builds an image data set for
you on the fly so you don't need to
build the labels you don't need to
actually build the classes it's going to
do it for you and it's actually going to
do a bunch of pre-processing out of the
box so it'll resize your images as well
now let's actually take a look at the
doco for that nope we don't want to take
a look at that yet so if we go to
tf.keras.utils
utils dot image
so it is actually going to batch your
images into this batch of 32 it's going
to resize your images into 256 by 256
it's going to shuffle them you can also
create a validation split so on and so
forth but it's pretty cool right so it
actually allows you to do a ton of stuff
right off the bat so this is a super
useful helper if you're building image
classification models so we're going to
get rid of that
so we're actually going to create this
data set now
so i've just gone and run this line here
so we are then going to store our data
set into a folder called or into a
variable called data
so this means that we can now take a
look at the data itself
now
the nice thing about the data part or
well actually
it's nice but it's also a little bit
painful so if i let's say for example i
wanted to go and take a look at this
data i can't just go and grab the first
instance
because this isn't a
data set which is pre-loaded into memory
already it is actually a generator so on
the fly we actually need to go and grab
the data that we want now the easiest
way to do that is to convert it into a
numpy iterator first which is what this
next line is doing
so
we are going to go and create a data
iterator so data underscore iterator
equals data dot as numpy iterator so you
probably would have seen me do this
before in the face verification tutorial
i actually did it there so this is going
to convert or allow us to access the
generator from our data pipeline so data
underscore iterator equals data as numpy
iterator then we can actually get
consecutive batches using the dot next
method so i'll show you this in a sec so
if we go and run that now then our next
line of code is actually going to run
dot next so this is actually going to
get us a batch back but first up let's
take a look at our data iterator so you
can actually see it is an iterator so
also like a generator so you can loop
through and continuously pull data
batches back right and again this is
probably not hyper useful right now but
when you get to significantly more
sophisticated deep learning models where
you've got massive amounts of data gonna
make your life a ton easier
but
for now let's actually take a look so we
are then going to grab one batch so if
you think about it this way so this is
building our data pipeline
this is actually allowing us to access
our data pipeline and then this is
actually accessing the data pipeline
itself so this is allowing us to loop
through it this is grabbing one batch
back so if i go and run this line
this batch let's actually take a little
batch before we visualize it so if i
type in batch
so this is actually a batch of data so
this should have a shape of two or it
should have two variables on two parts
of the tuple
now you're probably thinking nick what
the hell is this number two well there's
two parts to this data set there is the
images and then there's the labels so
the first part is actually the image
representation so it's our images from
our directory loaded into memory as a
set of numpy arrays so if i go and grab
that first value
we've got a whole bunch of arrays here
yeah can you see that
now if we take a look at the shape
we should have all of our images loaded
so if i type in dot shape
so we've got a batch size of 32 and
remember this is based on the image
underscore data set underscore from
underscore directory helper method we
can configure that if we wanted
more images per batch if we actually
wanted different image shapes but this
is the nice thing about that particular
utility it automatically reshapes our
images to ensure that they are of a
consistent size and it also batches them
up into a batch size of 32 but again you
can configure all of this so let's say
for example um i go let's actually go
and grab it so tf.keras.utils.image
dataset from directory
so if i wanted more images per batch i
can increase that let's say for example
you don't have as much vram on your gpu
you could actually drop that batch size
and the way that you would do this is
let's say that that's your data
directory you would type in batch
underscore size
equals i don't know 16 for example yeah
or you'd go batch size equals eight
so you can change that if you wanted
your image size to be different you
could actually pass through that keyword
argument so image and the score size
equals i don't know let's say 128 by 128
so it would actually allow you to
configure what you want your data set to
look like
for now the defaults are going to work
cool all right so we're taking a look at
our batch um so we took a look so these
are the images right so this is the
images represented
as numpy arrays
now
let's say what about the labels so if we
go to batch z one
this should be the labels there you go
so in this particular case we've got a
flag of one we've got a flag of zero
zero zero zero one one one now these
actually represent the labels so one is
going to represent either happy or sad
and zero is going to represent either
happy or sat i couldn't quite work out
whether or not there's a way to dictate
which
class belongs to which number now i know
there is a way i think there is a way
that you can actually configure this i
know for sure that you can do it using
the
tf.data.dataset api because i do it a
ton um with this default helper i'm not
too sure actually how you actually go
about configuring that but there's one
easy way around that you just double
check which class is assigned to which
type of image and this is what this plot
is going to allow you to do here
so over here we can see that the one
flag is actually assigned to sad images
and the zero flag is assigned to happy
images so you can see one there
one sad person zero happy people
zero happy people zero happy people now
let's say for example we wanted to
visualize another batch of data well we
can actually go and run this line over
here again because we are going to get
another batch get another
batch from the iterator
it's director if we go and run this
again our batch size is not going to
change
but our classes so you should see these
numbers change over here right so if we
go and run this again you can see that
we've now got a new batch of data from
our data pipeline and just for our own
purposes let's write a note so class one
equals sad people
people
and then class
zero
equals
happy
people
and if we go and run our visualization
again you're gonna see that so zero
happy people one sad people one sad
people one sad people
who is that is that timberland kid cardi
i don't know um but over here what we're
doing is we're actually using matplotlib
and matplotlib's subplots function to be
able to plot out four images at a
particular time
cool but that is our data set now
brought in so we've actually got that
now read in let's uh let's quickly
review what we've done so we have
successfully
installed a bunch of dependencies and
set them up we've removed any dodgy
images we might have and we've also gone
and loaded up our data using the keras
image data set from directory helper
let's jump back on over and have a chat
to our client and see what's next
all right so now that we've got some
data loaded what's next we've got to get
pre-processing what pre-processing for
image data we tend to pre-process by
scaling the image values to between 0
and 1 instead of zero to 255 this helps
our deep learning model generalize
faster and produces better results cool
anything else we've got to do yep we're
also going to split up our data into
training testing and validation
partitions to ensure that we don't
overfit let's get to it and we are back
so now what we're on to doing is
pre-processing our data so we've got our
data loaded but now we've got to do some
pre-processing and this is where step
two comes in so there's two things that
we're going to do here we are going to
scale our data and by that what i mean
is that when we loaded in our data over
here actually let me tell you so if we
actually go to our data so if i type in
batch and remember our batch is composed
of two parts our images and our labels
so our images are going to be in key 0
and our labels are going to be in key
one
if we go to or index one whatever you
want to call it uh if we go to the first
thing then this is going to be our
images so if we type in dot shape all of
our images all right so we've got 32
images of shape 256 by 256 by three
channels
now
when you load in an images of
representation of a number of channels
which are going to be rgb for opencv
it's going to be bgr when you use
tensorflow i think it's rgb
but it's going to be of the values 0 to
255.
so if i type in dot min does that work
yep
so this means our lowest value is 0.0
and dot max should return 255.
now when you're building deep learning
models ideally you want the values to be
as small as possible this is going to
help you optimize a ton faster so what
we can do is really quickly is all we
really need to do is divide these values
by 255
and that is going to give us values
between zero and one now so if i type in
uh certain let's say um scaled
so if i type in scaled
and then we type in dot min
so the last value is still zero the
maximum value
now one so this means that we've
successfully scaled our data but
remember that we are using a data
pipeline so we can't necessarily go and
do this every single time we load up a
batch what we want to do in order to do
it most efficiently is just do it as
we're loading in the data through the
data pipeline using the data pipeline
capability
so let's actually go and take a look at
how we might do this
inside of the data pipeline we've
actually got a function called map and
this allows us to apply a particular
type of transformation
as our data is being pre-processed
through the data pipeline now this means
that when we go on pre-fetch data it's
going to do that transformation as well
so this means that it speeds up how
quickly we can access our data from our
disk
so what we've got in written is data
equals data dot map this is really
really important guys pay attention the
data.map actually allows you to perform
that transformation in pipeline so
data.map and then we're using a lambda
function to be able to go and do that
transformation so when we go and access
our batch remember we're going to get
our images and our labels so x is going
to represent our images because those
are our what is it our independent
features so we are going to be passing
those in y is going to be our target
variable so that is what you can see
there or effectively our labels
what we're going to do is that as we
load in a batch we are going to go and
get our data over here so you can see
we've got x and we're going to divide it
by 255 that is our scaling
and we are going to form no
transformation on our y so if we go and
run that
we've now effectively applied that
transformation step on our data pipeline
now there are a ton of additional um
transformations you can do inside of a
data pipeline or a tensorflow data set
pipeline right and if you just go to
tens flow
data set
api i know tensorflow data api
yeah tf.data
right there are a ton of functions so if
i go to tf.data where is it here
over here
so tf.data.dataset
there are a ton of functions so over
here you can see that there are an
absolute ton so we are using the map
function which you can see there
and again this allows you to do a whole
bunch of stuff across elements within a
data set exactly what it's saying there
there's a whole bunch of other ways that
you can use it we're using it in this
particular manner over here
cool cool
the other ones that i tend to use a ton
are zip so let's say for example i
wanted to combine a
set of features and labels zip oh sorry
just slap the mic zip is a way to
combine those um skip you'll probably
see that in a second
what's another one
from generator tensor slices from
tensors these are pretty common as well
but i'll include a link to this inside
of the description below so you can see
it as well but that is effectively our
data scaled right
so now
if we go and take a look at a next batch
you can see that we are doing that
inside of our data pipeline so this is
no different to what we did from up here
so rather than going and creating
separate variables from our iterator we
can actually access our data that like
that as well so data dot and then dot as
numpy iterator so that gives us access
to our iterator and then dot next is
going to grab our next batch now keep in
mind this is going to if we're not
applying shuffling it's going to return
back the exact same values each and
every time in this case we've got
shuffling so you can see that our data
is changing
let's just grab our first set of at
images so again we can grab our images
by grabbing the first index if we type
in dot max
you can see them wait hold on that is a
very low max dot min
zero dot max
0.03 that seems very low
let's grab another batch
uh so we can let's call this scaled
equals
scaled iterator
data.as numpyre
and then if we go scale to iterator
dot next
these all look awfully low
maybe we've just got uh images which
aren't all that bright or aren't that
colorful
let's go dot max
we need to grab our first value again
grab the next batch
seems awfully low
let's actually take a look at it using
our
using our plotting function over here so
if we grab that
so let's grab a batch so that's our data
then we can grab the iterator and then
let's just grab create a batch here
kind of weird that they're so low batch
equal scale data.next
all right so data equals that this is
going to be our scale iterator grab a
next batch
what does this look like they're all
black
something has gone wrong there
let's go and reload our data so
grab our data set
and skip that bit let's go and run
through that pipeline
wait hold up so because we've gone and
divided our images by
255 they're no longer going to be
integers but right over here inside of
our visualization function we are
converting them to integers but in this
particular case they'd all be 0 because
they're between 0 and 1. so if i divide
this is now on a set of our scale data
right so data's now got a lambda
function let's just go and reload our
data over here
this is reestablishing our data pipeline
we're then going and running it through
our lambda then if we go and take our
next batch let's go through our scale
data set
this is going to be our scale data
perfect so if we go and type dot as type
into
right that's going to turn them all
black no go
colored let's just double check so batch
okay so that looks a little bit better
now hold on so if we go batch zero
dot max
okay one
dot min i don't know what's happening
there but that looks like it's okay
good good thing that we're double
checking that this data is appropriately
function maybe we went around that data
pipeline twice so we're going and
dividing by 255 twice that's the only
thing that i can think of there but if
we go and reload or re-establish our
data set by going and running this line
over here
and then if we go and apply a lambda
again
go and test this out
right so max is one i'm in
is zero now if we go and visualize
perfect all right cool so that is our
data now scaled so we know that our
images are now between zero and one the
next thing that we want to go on ahead
and do is split our data into a training
and testing partition this means that
when it comes to actually going and
validating our data and ensuring that
our model hasn't overfit we've actually
got specific partitions
so in order to do this we are first up
going to establish what our training
data sizes should be so let's just
quickly take a look at the length of our
data in its entirety
so we have seven batches and remember
each batch is going to have 32 images so
there's probably one that's going to be
truncated if it's not equal batches but
that is the number of batches that we've
got so our training set is going to be
70 of that data so that should be what
uh 50 what is it 49 so it would be like
what five batches or seven times point
seven
right so we'll have roughly five batches
there then we're going to have
20 assigned to validation so that'll
probably be one and then this will
probably be one as well let's just see
what this comes out as
so how big is our training size four so
it's rounded down how big is our
validation size
one and how big is our test size
zero so all right so we should probably
add one to that so that means we'll have
four plus one plus one that's only going
to give us six so let's add an
additional one to our validation
partition so
train is going to now be
four batches validation is now going to
be
two batches and test is now going to be
one batch so train
plus or train size plus vowel size
plus test size
equals seven which equals this right so
we're good to go now let me quickly
explain what we're doing here so our
training data is going to be what is
used to actually train our deep learning
model our validation data is going to be
what we use to evaluate our model while
we're training so this means that our
model hasn't necessarily seen our
validation partition but we're using it
to fine tune how we actually build this
deep learning model and it's good
practice to have a training and
validation partition as you're building
up these models your test partition your
model is not going to have seen until we
get to the final evaluation state so we
hold that out all the way until the end
so these two are using are used during
training this one is used post training
to do the evaluation and right now all
we're establishing is how much data
we're going to allocate to each one of
these partitions so we are going to have
7 multiplied by 32 image or wait hold on
we're going to have four multiplied by
32 images allocated to our training
partition we're going to have two
multiplied by 32 images allocated to our
validation partition and we're going to
have one batch assigned to our test size
now
uh we don't need to take a look at that
in order to do this we actually can use
the take and skip methods available
inside of the tensorflow dataset
pipeline so if i actually show you this
so over here you can see
we've got take and skip so take defines
how much data we are going to take in
that particular partition so if we go
and run this line here
so our training size
so uh len
is for batches aval
data is two batches and our test data
is one batch
so in order to do this first up what
we're doing is we're saying train
equals data dot take and then we're
saying how many batches we want to
allocate to our training data now keep
in mind our data is already shuffled if
your data hadn't been shuffled you want
to shuffle it before you do this so
train is going to equal four batches so
train equals data dot take and then to
that we're passing through train size
val is gonna equal data dot skip so
first up what we're gonna do is we're
gonna skip the batches that we've
already allocated to our training
partition and then we're gonna take the
last two into our valve data so data dot
skip and we're going to skip the first
four which we've allocated to train and
then we're going to take two based on
the vowel size so take two and then we
are going to take two batches and that
is what our validation partition is
going to look like then our test is
going to be everything left over right
so test equals data dot skip and we're
going to skip the training data and the
validation data and then we're going to
take the rest which should be our test
partition
and that is how you establish your train
test and validation partitions and that
is the last step in our pre-processing
stage as well so we've now gone
and scaled our data and i sort of showed
you how to actually go and apply that
lambda layer or the map layer and we
also saw that we had a bit of an issue
there right so we saw that our data
wasn't necessarily scaled and this is
potentially because we went and applied
this twice
now in order to fix that all you need to
do is go and re-run this line over here
and go and re-run this particular line
here and again we're overwriting
variables so again that can be a little
bit sketchy in terms of how we can
actually trace that back so you might
actually go and choose to call this um
scale data
so that way you can't override it twice
but in this case we are good so our data
is scaled our data is now between 0 and
255 we've gone and taken a look and
visualized it and we have also gone and
created our train validation and testing
partitions let's jump back on over to
our client
all righty onto the good bit now that
our data's pre-processed we can begin
modeling i've always told my mom i was
destined for the catwalk what uh yeah
what we're going to do now is build our
deep learning model using the keras
sequential api nice so this is the ai
bit right right come on gisele let's do
this all right so we are now on to the
good bit actually doing the deep
learning so in terms of doing this there
are going to be three components so
first up we are going to build a deep
neural network and in order to do that
we're probably going to need to import a
bunch of stuff then we're actually going
to go on ahead and train the specific
deep learning model
in order to do this we can actually use
the dot fit method and then we're also
going to plot our performance using
matplotlib as well okay so first things
first let's go and import some
dependencies using tensorflow so
first up what we're going to be doing is
we are going to be importing the
sequential api so in order to do that
within from tensorflow.keras.models
import sequential now the reason that i
make this distinction is that there are
two really specific models or two
specific
like model building apis available
inside of tensorflow and keras the first
one is called sequential and that's what
we're going to be using this is great if
you've got one data input and one data
output and the model sort of just flows
from top to bottom there is another type
of api and that is the functional api
and that is really really powerful if
you've got like multiple inputs multiple
outputs multiple connections you need to
do a whole bunch of fancy stuff with
deep learning models so um i've
definitely got one of those coming up
for you a little bit more advanced but
we do have that coming up so sequential
is great if you need something quick and
easy and that's what we're going to be
doing in this case for deep learning
classification
then the next thing that we're bringing
in are a whole bunch of layers so the
layers that we've brought in are
available through from
tensorflow.keras.layers import conf 2d
so this is a convolutional neural
network layer so if we actually type in
conf 2d into google and we don't want
the pi torch equivalent we want the
tensorflow equivalent
so this is a 2d convolutional layer eg
spatial convolution over images which is
exactly what we're doing
so we're bringing in a convolutional 2d
or conv 2d layer a max pooling layer
which effectively
acts as a like think of it like a
condensing layer so it actually goes
through your images and actually
condenses it down so it goes what's the
max value in this region only return
that region so rather than returning all
of the data from our convolution we
actually condense it down then we're
bringing in dents so this is a fully
connected layer available through keras
we'll also bring in the flattened layer
so this is what allows us to go for a
convolutional layer which has
channels or kernels
namely channels and it actually reduces
it back into a format which our dense
layer will be able to take so that we
can only get one output at the end and
then we've got dropout which is
typically used for regularization but i
don't think we actually use that in this
but anyway we've got a whole bunch of
layers so typically when you're building
neural networks you're going to form an
architecture and an architecture is a
whole bunch of different layers or
hidden layers which form a deep neural
network so
in order to do that first up we are
going to create or let's actually go and
import that first up we are going to
create a model and we are establishing
that as so so model equals sequential
now i'm going to show you the way that i
typically do this but you can always um
pass through the layers inside of the
sequential class so i could actually do
conv 2d here
and then add in all the stuff and then
just sort of stack these as so but i
typically use the add method and
actually sort of chain them on when i'm
using the sequential api but you'll see
people do it like that as well so um
that's just the thing to call out if you
see people doing using the sequential
api like that perfectly fine this is
just a matter of choice so we are
establishing our sequential class or an
instance of our sequential class so
written model equals sequential and a
set of parentheses now we're going to
add in our layers this is where the
magic happens so we have let me break
this out
we're not actually using dropout we
could actually get rid of that would
still work over here so we've got three
convolution blocks we have a flattened
layer and we've got two dense layers so
let's break this up so this first
section over here is performing or
adding a convolutional layer and a max
pooling layer so model dot add and
remember how i said that you can either
stack them or pass them direct to the
sequential class or you can use
model.add to add layers now i'm adding
this sequentially so this means that the
first layer in my deep neural network is
first up going to be an input so we
whenever you're passing through a first
layer that first layer needs to have an
input or either needs to be an input
layer now again i'll talk about that
more when we do functional models later
on but
know that our first layer is a
convolution here so model.add and we're
adding a convolution and this
convolution is going to have 16 filters
that is what a convolution has so it's
got a whole bunch of filters and it
basically scans over an image and tries
to condense or extract the relevant
information inside of that image to make
an output classification
so we've got 16 filters and our filter
is going to be three pixels by three
pixels in size and we are going to
strike have a stride of one this means
that it's going to move one pixel each
time so it's gonna go bang bang bang so
on and so forth now you can increase
that stride you can increase the number
of filters you can increase um the size
of the filters these are all what we
call architectural decisions now you
might have actual like state-of-the-art
models which actually prescribe how you
do this so if you actually go and take a
look at how imagenet does classification
there is a specific architecture that is
used there
how we actually go and change these
particular hyper parameters or these
particular model parameters influences
what our model performs like
but typically when you're doing a
convolution you have the number of
filters the size of the filter and the
stride another really important function
or another aspect of it is the
activation that gets applied so here we
are applying a relu activation so let me
show you this a relu
activation really all we're saying is
that we're taking the output from this
convolutional layer and we're going to
pass it through a function that looks
like this so that means that any output
that was pre previously below zero
is now going to be converted to zero and
we are going to preserve the positive
values so this effectively means that we
are
converting any negative values to zero
and anything that's positive remains
unchanged this allows us to take into
account a non-linear patterns right so
if you've just got or if you've got no
activations and really all you're
building is a deep neural network which
is linear in nature so it's not
necessarily that powerful this is where
the power comes from applying all these
activations there are a ton of them
right so another popular one that we'll
use as well is a sigmoid activation
and that looks like this now these can
sound really complex but just think
about it as that we're taking all of our
data or all of the output from a layer
and we're passing it through this
function to modify what the output looks
like right so we might have a whole
bunch of numbers between um i don't know
negative infinity and positive infinity
or like really really small or really
really big values
but by going and actually changing it
i'm passing it through one of these
activations we're reshaping what that
output looks like right and we're
reshaping what the function looks like
as a result of that as well
cool so
what's the full line i've gone through
and talked about this a ton but so we're
going to read a model model.addconf2d so
we're going to have 16 filters of shape
3x3 and then we are going to have a
stride of 1 and a pass through a relu
activation we are also going to specify
what our input shape looks like now
remember that i said that the keras
tense what is that image data set from
directory function actually reshapes our
images well our images are going to be
in the shape 256 pixels by 256 pixels by
three channels so they're going to be
256 pixels higher by 256 pixels wired by
three channels deep and again we pass
this through into our initial we just
passed it through in our first layer
here
then we're applying a max pooling layer
so this is just gonna take the maximum
value after the relu activation and it's
going to return back that value so it's
going to scan across and go it's
effectively going to condense the
information it's not just going to take
one number it's actually going to do it
over a set region so
what is this let's actually take a look
what's the default max pooling 2d
question mark question mark so it's
going to go over a two by two region so
you can see two by two two by two
and it's going to take the max value out
of that two by two region so it's
effectively going to reduce our image
data i think by half in that particular
case so rather than having well yeah
half
based on the rows or half based on the
rows half based on the width as well so
it's going to condense that information
down
and then we've effectively got another
one of those blocks over here so again
the next set of laser we're adding so
model.addconf2d
so we've now got 32 filters of shape 3x3
of stride 1 and again we've got relu
activation now the max pooling rate so
then we've got another convolution block
then we've got exactly the same over
here this time we've just got 16 filters
and then what we're doing is we're
actually flattening this data down so
when we actually apply a convolutional
layer
the filters are going to be the last
channel so we're going to condense the
rows and the width and then the number
of filters will form the channel value
now
when we actually go and pass this to our
dense layer we don't want that channel
value right because we want to condense
it down to a single value so by
flattening it that's what we're
effectively doing so then we're now
going to have 256 values as our output
and then finally one value as our output
here so if we actually go and run this
oh well let's actually talk about this
in a little bit more detail so we've
gone and flattened it then the last two
layers that we apply are dense layers so
these are fully connected layers so if
you've ever seen a neural network you
see a lot of little dots and they're all
connected and they form go down to a
point these are referred to as fully
connected layers
so inside of keras we call them dense
layers so we've got dents we have 256
neurons and again we're applying relu
activations here and then our final
layer is a single dense layer this means
that we're going to get a single output
and that output is effectively going to
represent 0 or 1 because we have a
sigmoid activation
so if we take a look at what our sigmoid
activation does let's zoom in
our sigmoid activation takes any output
and converts it into effectively a range
between 0
and 1. now as 0 and one map to our happy
and sad classes so if it is zero that is
i think what i can't even remember what
it is now so if it's zero it's going to
be a happy person and if it's one it's
going to be a sad person that is what
our final layer is going to output there
so you can see that there cool right
and that is our deep neural network so
if we go and run that layer
that is successfully run
the next thing that we need to do is
compile that so this is the next most
important bit in your neural network so
we type in model.compile and remember
our model was initially initialized up
here
and then to that we pass through a few
things we pass through the optimizer
that we want to use and in this case
we're going to be using the atom
optimizer there are a ton of optimizers
so if we type in tf.keras
actually is it tf.optimizers dot there
are a ton
so we've got ada delta adagrad adam adam
max uh ftrl i haven't seen that one too
much uh n atom rms propped sgd so again
there's a ton of optimizers that are
actually available so
in this case we're going to be using the
atom optimizer then we're specifying
what our loss is and our loss in this
particular case because we are
performing effectively a binary
classification problem it's going to be
tf.losses.binarycrossentropy
and the metric that we want to track is
accuracy you can pass through a bunch
more in this particular case but our
accuracy is going to tell us how well
our model is classifying as either 0 or
1.
so if we go and compile it
this is my favorite bit so by typing in
model.summary you can actually see how
our model transforms our data
so remember our model takes in an input
of shape 256 by 256 by 3 right 256 by
256 by 3.
our first convolution layer converts it
to be 254 by 254
by the number of filters so that 16 is
coming from up here then we apply a max
pooling layer so it converts it from 254
to 54 by 16 to 127 by 127 by 16. that
127 remember how i said because it is
shape 2-2 it's taking 254 divided by 2
which gives us 127. so it effectively
halves the output that we're getting out
of this convolutional layer there
but it is not a trainable layer right so
you can see that there's no parameters
assigned to it so it shouldn't
effectively increase the size of our
model too much it just condenses stuff
down
then we're going and applying another
convolution layer so again this one's
going to 125 by 125 by 32
now we could actually preserve the size
from over here by applying some padding
but i'm not going to delve into that for
now so we're going 125 by 125 by 2 and
again we've got 32 filters that is
coming from over here
and then we are applying max pooling
again so it's going to be halving our
data
then we've got our last convolution
block 60 by 60 by 16 we're playing
convolutions 30 by 30 by 16 and then
we're getting our flattened layer right
so we've got 14
400 values
let me enable scrolling so i can show
you this so what we're doing is we're
taking the outputs from this max pooling
layer and we're converting it into a
single dimension so if we type in what
is that 30 by 30 by 16
that is the number of outputs which are
passed to our flattened layer so you can
see that we're getting all of these
dimensions or all of these elements here
that multiply by that multiplied by that
gives us the number of inputs that are
going into our flattened layer so we're
condensing them down into a single
dimension so rather than having a
multi-dimension or multi-rank tensor
we're converting it down to that
then we pass it to our dense layer which
is 256 uh what is it neurons which is
over here
and then we finally go down to a single
layer over here a single output layer
cool
now if you're probably wondering why
this is 257 parameters keep in mind
there's a bias term as well right so
it's it's going to be the value of the
weights from your neurons plus the bias
term
that gives us our total number of
parameters so three million six hundred
ninety six thousand six hundred and
twenty five values so it's pretty uh
it's not
monstrous right you've probably seen
like bert or big bert like those are
massive models gpt3 huge as is 3.7
million now we could probably condense
that down as well if we really wanted to
but that particular case that is our
deep neural network now modeled so
we can get rid of this get rid of that
that is our neural network
that is step 3.1 and now done so we've
now gone and built our deep learning
model right and so we've taken a look at
our imports we've taken a look at some
of the different types of layers that
we'll use and we've also seen how we can
stack these layers up now the next thing
that we want to do is actually go on
ahead and train so first thing we're
going to create a log directory and
we've already got this created so you
can see over here
i've got a folder called logs
so we are just going to create a
variable which points to that and then
we're going to create a callback so
these callbacks are really really useful
if you wanted to
save your model at a particular
checkpoint if you wanted to do some
specific logging which is what we're
going to do
now
in order to do this we're creating a
callback so tensorboard underscore
callback and we're setting that equal to
tf.keras.callbacks.tensorboard
and we're specifying the log directory
equal to this logs folder over here so
when you go and do this you're going to
have your tensorboard logs logged out
i'm going to talk about this more in a
future tutorial but we're setting it up
now so tensorboard underscore callback
and we're passing through this parameter
here so this is going to log out
your model training as its training so
if you wanted to come back and see how
your model performed did it vary at a
particular point in time do we need to
drop our learning rate you're actually
going to see that inside of these boards
but we can actually just plot them using
the history that you collect from your
training step which i'll show you in a
sec
cool
so that's our callback established
now we're going to go on ahead and fit
our model so there's two really really
important methods when it comes to
building a neural network model.fit and
model.predict so fit is the training
comport component predict is when we
actually go and make predictions so
model.fit is going to take in our
training data and remember our training
data was four batches of 32 images each
our epochs is how long we're actually
going to go ahead and train for and one
epoch is one run over our entire
training set of data
we're also going to pass through our
validation data so this means that after
we've gone and performed a or gone and
trained on all of our training data or
training batches we're then going to run
evaluation on our validation data so we
can actually see how well our model is
performing in real time
then we're also going to pass through
our callbacks so if we wanted to go and
apply additional callbacks or let me
know if you want a tutorial on callbacks
guys i'm more than happy to do it so
here we're actually specifying that we
want to log out all of the information
from our model to tensorboard so we
could open it up inside a tensorboard
later on
um and by storing it inside of a
variable called hist or history we're
going to be able to take out all of the
training information from our training
data and our validation data and plot
them out inside of step 3.3 so if we
actually go and run this now this is
going to kick off our training run so
let's run it
and you'll actually see our deep
learning model start training
so it might take a little while to start
but eventually you'll start to see it
training so it's going really really
fast because we've obviously got a gpu
but that is now training
you can see it's taking what 377
milliseconds per step our loss is going
down so ideally you want to see your
loss go down and your accuracy go up
and so what you've got over here so this
is the loss on your training data this
is your training let me zoom in because
you probably can't see that this is the
loss on your training data this is the
accuracy for your training data this is
your validation loss
and this is your validation accuracy so
ideally you want to see them or you want
to see your losses decrease both pretty
consistently and pretty steadily and you
want to see your accuracies go up pretty
steadily as well
over here so you can see it's definitely
performing way better so look our losses
drop down significantly and our accuracy
has got up to a hundred percent so again
it's performing really really well by
the end
and that was it so it went really really
quickly
that's how deep neural network trained
guys that's how quick it goes so um this
is obviously with a gpu so it's a lot
faster with out a gpu i think we saw
roughly a
double increase in the training time so
again you'll still be able to do this
without a gpu but
that is our deep neural network now
trained the magic is done now
cool thing is because we've gone and
saved it inside of or saved our training
history inside of a variable called
history we can actually get a whole
bunch of information from this so if i
show you hist
there is this shows us that callback so
if i type in history history
there is a whole bunch of information
available in here let me scroll so you
can see that we've got our loss
information we've got our accuracy
information so that's on our training
data also got our validation loss
information and we should also have our
validation accuracy information which
you can see there pretty cool right but
we can actually plot this performance
out
which is what i've got here so here i'm
just using matplotlib so plot.plot and
we're grabbing our training loss and
we're grabbing our validation loss and
we're plotting those so here what you're
going to see is that our training loss
has the color teal and our validation
loss has the
has the color orange
let's go and plot it out
so you can see that our loss has sort of
decreased pretty steadily over time we
have we've had one bit of a spike there
but it's sort of come back
if you start to see your loss going down
and your validation loss sort of rising
up that that is an indication that your
model may be overfitting so it might be
time to look at applying some
regularization might also mean that we
need to apply some data
or change some data if you don't see
these decreasing at all or if you see
your green line like not decreasing or
going weird this might mean that you
need to take a look at your training
data again maybe potentially consider a
larger neural network or a more
sophisticated neural network because
that means that it's not able to learn
or reduce the loss for that particular
data or that training data overall
so it might mean we have a bit of a bias
problem
okay so um if you the validation law
starts tearing off that might mean you
have a variance problem so again
regularization is your friend in that
particular case
okay so we've got our loss metrics so
visualize those uh
now we can also take a look at our
accuracy metrics so again this sort of
little block here is pretty useful
because you can actually visualize just
about anything that you want
and it's really really useful when
you're doing deep learning as well
because if you added more metrics
so let me go scroll up
if we added in more metrics when we're
compiling our model you'd actually be
able to visualize all of them so in the
iris tracking video that i'm working on
as well i actually show how to do that
for a whole bunch of metrics
okay so that is our last visualize now
we can also visualize our accuracy so
again we're using matplotlib to
visualize these so if we go and run this
one
you can see our accuracy steadily
increased over time we had a little bit
of a pop out there but again we've come
back
and it has resolved back up to 100
accuracy which is very very good right
obviously this model is performing well
there's not a ton of data so ideally
you'd want to flesh this out with a ton
more data but in that particular case
that is our model now trained so we've
actually gone and completed our modeling
step so we've gone and built our deep
learning model and we've used this
sequential api we've gone and trained
our model using the model.fit function
and i've also shown you how to pass
through your training data your
validation data as well as setting up a
callback and we've also gone and taken a
look at our training performance so
we've visualized our loss and we've also
visualized our accuracy let's jump back
on over to our client and we might be on
to our evaluation step
so we've finished training our model now
it's time to test it out of course wait
what does that mean well think of how
you might test an athlete you put the
athlete through its paces and review
certain metrics so you might measure a
sprinter by their 100 meter dash time
for our classification model we'll do
the same ah got it so we're going to
check how fast our model is
not quite we've got a few different
metrics we'll use for classification
these include precision recall and
accuracy let's jump to it so we're in
the end game now evaluating performance
so we've gone and trained our model the
next thing that we want to do is
actually go and evaluate performance on
our testing data because remember we
held out that partition that our model
has never seen before so there's two
things we want to do first up evaluate
it and then we'll also grab some random
images and test that out
so
in order to evaluate we're going to
import a couple of key metrics so from
tensorflow.keras.metrics import
precision recall and binary accuracy
these are different measures that you
typically use for classification
problems so i'm going to import those
and then what we can do or in order to
use them we need to establish instances
of them
and then what we can do is update our
state as we actually go and make
predictions so we can go and instantiate
those i've written pre and these are
pretty crappy variable names i think i
was running out of energy so pre equals
precision and again we're grabbing this
class over here creating it
re equals recall
and then accuracy equals binary accuracy
then in order to go and test them out
we're going to loop through each batch
in our testing data which i think we
only had one
batch anyway right
the len test nope lower case
one batch anyway so four batch in test
dot as numpy iterator so that's going to
bring back our batch and then we can
unpack it so x comma y equals batch so
this is going to be our set of images
this is effectively our y true value
then we're passing through our image
data to our model so model.predict is
how we make predictions and that is
going to return back a set of values
between zero and one because remember
we've gone and passed it through a
sigmoid activation
so in order to update our metrics we can
then type in or use the update state
method so
precision.updatestate and we pass
through our y true value and our
predicted value of i've gone and screwed
that up so pass through our y true value
and our y hat value so you can see those
there
and we've gone and done that for
precision a recall and for accuracy so
we'll then be able to see how it's
actually performed on our test data so
if i go and run that it should run for a
little sec and then we can actually
print out those results so to actually
make
this a little bit easier to read so uh f
equals uh precision result
so this is precision
or ecr
and i think we can write dot numpy as
well
and uh what is this this is recall
dot numpy
and this is accuracy
my head blocking that off nope okay
got num hi
uh what have we done we haven't finished
it gotta close that
boom okay
i should close that over there all right
so there we go so we've now gone and
printed out our performance on each of
those different metrics our precision is
one so a higher precision means your
model is performing better a recall is
one again high value on recall means
you're performing better and that
accuracy is one so again higher value
means you're performing better now the
each of these metrics are between zero
and one so this is the highest possible
value it can take um now again if you
want to deep dive on how these metrics
are calculated or let's say for example
wanted to do a confusion matrix let me
know and i can delve into those but just
know that this model is performing
pretty much as well as it can on a
single batch of data and considering how
little data we've actually given it to
perform
so we've got a precision of 100 a recall
of 100 and an accuracy of a hundred
percent as well now normally i don't
like to leave it there i like to
actually go and test it out on data
that's outside of that batch so
let's actually go on ahead and do this
now the first import that we're going to
import is cv2 but i thought we've
already imported opencv
we have we should have
we imported it when we're doing the ht
yeah we've already got that so we can
actually skip that
we don't need to import opencv but for
now let's just import it anyway i'm
wasting time
what we're going to do is we're going to
read in an image that our model has
never seen before so what we're going to
do is let's go and grab a random image
so let's actually go to page 2 or scroll
further down
let's grab this dude
so i'm going to save this image and i'm
going to save it into our image
classification folder we're going to
call this sad test
and let's saved it as jfif i don't know
why google does that so frustrating sad
test dot jpg
is it yes okay cool then we're gonna get
an image of a happy person
happy peoples
find a happy dude
so this is completely out of sample
right our model's never seen this before
let's go
this one's great all right let's save
this image
so happy um that's webp that's not gonna
work
so again it needs to be jpg it's just
gonna make your life a whole bunch
easier let's grab this one
happy test dot jpg
okay cool so i've got two test images so
if i open up my folders so you can see
why they're not there there we go so
we've got happytest.jpg so this is that
girl that's super happy and we've got a
sad test but this dude dark and stormy
is red ready to drop a beat all right
now what we're going to do
is we are going to read in that image
using cv2.iamread
and so first up let's read in a happy
image so we can type in
happy test dot jpg so that should read
in our image and we should plot it out
right now remember this opencv is going
to read it in as bgr rather than rgb do
we fix that here no we don't let me show
you how to do it cv2 cvt color
and then we're going to go and pass
through the color conversion code
cv2.color underscore bgr2rgb
and that should visualize it in its
correct color so there you go so we've
gone and fixed up the color there it's
gone and successfully loaded it
now remember when we pass through our
data to our neural network and need to
be in the shape 256 by 256x3
so 256 pixels high 256 pixels wide and
it needs to be three channels so what we
can actually do is use
tf.image.resize to resize our image
before we pass it through to our neural
network so if we actually go and run
this
that is what our image looks like now
resized now again we could go and apply
the
cv2cv2.cvt color method over here
and grab this
paste it here
and we are throwing an error that is
because it is an integer
from that doesn't look like it's playing
nicely anyway we've gone and transformed
it now so
with uh tensorflow so you can see that
we've definitely gone and resized it
just because we've read it in using
opencv we're getting that weird coloring
but
let's actually go and test this out now
so if we actually go and pass this
through to our model so model.predict
and then we're passing it through to our
neural network so now quick word on what
how we're actually doing this prediction
our neural network expects us to pass
through a batch of images not a single
image so what we actually need to do is
we need to encapsulate it inside of
another set of parentheses or arrays or
put it inside of a list so in order to
do this and you'll see this done quite a
fair bit is we can type in np.expanddims
pass through our image which is right
now called resize because we've gone and
resize it using tf.image.resize
pass that into there and if i type in
what axis i want to apply the extra
dimension
you can see that right now it's just
stored inside of an extra dimension so
let me show you that the first value
you can see that we've got a whole bunch
of extra dimensions there this is the
first value
uh let's scroll it so you can see that
we don't have an extra set of
parentheses there by throwing it in
there literally all we're doing is we're
encapsulating it in another set of
arrays or putting it in inside of
another list so if i actually show you
the shape now dot shape
it's 1 by 256 by 256 by 3. if we take a
look at the shape for this
it's 256 by 256 by 3. so we're literally
just wrapping it in another set of
arrays now what we're also doing at the
same time is we're dividing about 255 to
scale it so if we go and run this
take a look at y hat so 0.28 so remember
what was a sad or happy person happy
person was zero
which you can see there so happy is zero
sad is one
so in this particular case our model has
successfully predicted that this
particular person is happy
now the reason that we're making this
assumption is if a particular in our
binary classification problem
what we're saying is that 50 is our
cutoff point so if it's below 50 we
round down to zero then this particular
case we're saying that our person is
going to be happy so it's successfully
classified that particular person we've
got y hat twice there we don't need that
now
the way that you can extrapolate this or
actually explain this in in regular
terms is that
our predicted class is happy if it is
less than 0.5 so if y hat is greater
than 0.5 the predicted class is going to
be sad otherwise the predicted class is
going to be happy which is exactly what
we've said over there so because it's
0.28 it is less than 0.5 which means
that our model has successfully
predicted it as happy pretty nuts right
like we didn't have a ton of data we
didn't even train for that long and
we've successfully gone and built a deep
neural network that performs
classification but let's actually go and
test it out on our sad person as well so
in order to do that we just need to pass
through a different image so this one's
going to be sad test
and if we go and run this
so our model has gone and given us a
probability of 86.8
which means it's going to be above 50
which means we have predicted sad
successfully take a look at that
predicted class is sad
so really quickly we've gone and been
able to perform or build a deep neural
network that is able to perform
sentiment classification using nothing
but a couple of images we've collected
from the web
let's go jump back on over to our client
and give him one last final update
alright home run baby you know it the
last thing we need to do is save our
model so we can reload it at a future
date so this means another developer or
engineer could use the model right right
this could also be deployed as an api or
to an edge device let's finish this
alrighty we're at the final step so
saving the model so this is a really
important step so you've gone through
all to this and this amount of effort
the last thing that you want to do is
save this model so you can go and use it
again if you did want to now this is
relatively straightforward we can import
or bring in the dependency from
tensorflow called load model so from
tensorflow.kerastop models import load
model
so then what we can do is actually use
this load model function to be able to
load up our model now first of all we
actually need to do save the model and
to do that we can just use model.save
now we're going to save it inside of the
folder models and we can name it just
about whatever we want so we could call
it um
happy sad model
and because we're saving it as a h5
model what we're actually doing is
something called serialization so we're
taking a model and we're serializing it
onto something that we can store as a
disk so this is similar to what you
might do when you zip a data set um when
you go and wire a data set h5 is a
serialization file format so it
basically means that you're going to
have a file called happysadmodel.h5
and then we can reload that using the
load model function up here so the full
line is model.save and then to that
we're passing os.path.join
and we're going to be saving it inside
of our models folder which i've already
got created over here nothing in there
at the moment
and we're going to be saving it as happy
sad model.h5 it could be whatever you
want it to save it as right if i go and
run that inside of our models folder you
can see we've now got our happy sad
model.h5 file over there
so we're looking good now the next thing
that we want to do is actually go and
reload this model so let's actually go
and rename it so we're going to call it
new underscore model and we can use load
underscore model to load that model back
up now we need to pass through the full
file path to our saved model in order to
reload it so we can actually grab this
h5 file name here pass it over to here
so we are basically saying it's going to
be inside of
the models folder
so models and then happysav model.h5 so
we're basically going to give it this
file path to be to the load model
function to be able to load it back up
so if we go and run this now
this is our new model it's a new model
is our sequential keras model
and if we go and pass data to it so
again we're going to pass through our
resize image so np dot expand dims
passing through our resize image which
we're scaling
and we should get a prediction again you
can see we're getting a sad prediction
if we go and run this again so let's
call this y hat
new
grab this block over here
so what we're going to say if y hat nu
greater than 0.5 you can see still
predicting sad
that in a nutshell is how to build a
deep neural network for image
classification so we've gone through a
ton of stuff in this tutorial let's
quickly recap so we first up went up and
set up our image or our environment to
be able to set up and load our data so
we're going to import a bunch of
dependencies we went and removed some
dodgy images and we went and downloaded
them originally from google now remember
you can get that image extension which
makes your life a whole bunch easier so
what was it called um
download all images it's just a google
chrome extension nothing fancy there it
just makes your life ton easier when
getting images we then went and loaded
our data set using the image data set
from directory method we went and
pre-processed our data so we scaled it
and we split it we then went and built
our deep neural network and went into a
bit of detail as to how we've actually
constructed this architecture we then
went and trained it using model.fit
took a look at our performance over time
we went and then finally evaluated it
over some new images that we've got off
the web and last but not least we've
gone and saved our model down to our
disk so we can bring it back when we
need to that in a nutshell is this
